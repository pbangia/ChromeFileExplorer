Features:

Folder navigation - can be done through the folder path displayed in the navigation bar, by clicking on folders in the folder list, or through the folder tree on the left. Also by using the forward/back actions. The default folder to open when the explorer is opened can be set through the settings menu.

Searching - Search for files and folders within the current directory in the search box.

Toggling hidden files - Hidden files can be toggled to be shown in the view or hidden.

Changing list/gallery view - click the list/gallery view toggle on the right side of the navigation bar to toggle between views.

Open a file - Chrome will be able to open video, photo, and documents when clicked. Supported file types include pdf, mp4, video, mp3, jpg, png, txt (includes javascript, css, json, other text based programming language files). If a file type isnâ€™t supported, Chrome will ask you to 'download' from a local copy and view it in your system viewer.

File preview mode - View an expanded preview of a file inside the file list itself. Long hover on a file in the list (must be a Chrome supported file type. eg - mp4 video/mp3, pdf, png, jpg, txt, etc). The long hover delay is in place to prevent unwanted file previews popping up while scrolling. Previews can be persisted from when you hover away by pinning previews using the pin feature while in preview mode.

Pin a file or folder - Click the pin icon on a file/folder item in the current directory to 'pin' the item to the pinned area. This will keep the item there when you navigate away or come back to reload the file explorer again. Useful for quick reference to frequent files or folders that a opened. Previews can also be pinned if you want to leave a file in preview mode after hovering away. The pin section can be hidden when not in use.

File tree - Can be shown/hidden by clicking the icon above it in the navigation bar. Shows the folder structure from the user's Users directory for quick decentralised folder browsing.

Copying a folder path - click the clip icon on files and folders to copy their local path's to your clipboard.

Sorting - Files and folders can be sorted by name, type, date modified and size by clicking the sort icon on the right side of the navigation bar and selecting the required sort option.
